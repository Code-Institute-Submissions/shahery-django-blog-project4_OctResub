# Agile Technique:
  * Agile technique is used in this project. You can have a look here
    [Agile](https://github.com/users/shahery/projects/4) 

  * Kanban board was used in this project to handle user stories.

    ![Kanban-board](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95220937/192648324-20ec45ad-93c6-4d84-bbf1-0ca55d2c496a.png)

  ## Bugs
    ### solved bugs
      * While creating the project I faced the bug of relation does not exist error, which actually took a lot of my time to solve. It was actually the migrations error because I accidentally deleted some migrations in my project.
      * Steps I took to solve:
          * Firstly, I deleted all the migrations in my apps except __init__.py file
          * Then I deleted the db.sqlite3 file showing in the files
          * Because the database I was using connected with heroku so I had to reset the database in the heroku platform and also I deleted the heroku postgres and added the new one and also added the new DATABASE_URL in the env.py file 
          * Then I commented out the admin.py, forms.py, models.py, views.py, urls.py files and also one line in the urls of  blogweb in which blog app was connected
          * Then I ran the command python3 manage.py makemigrations and python3 manage.py migrate
          * After that I uncommented the models.py file and ran the commands python3 manage.py makemigrations blog and python3 manage.py migrate blog for my models
          * And finally I uncommented all the files which I commented out before and ran the server using the command python3 manage.py runserver and the bug was fixed in this way.

 ## Unfixed Bugs
   * No unfixed bugs.

# Deployment
 This project was deployed using the code institute's mock terminal for heroku.
   * Steps for deployment:
     * Create the env.py file, requirements.txt file and Procfile in the github for the
       project you want to deploy
     * Make it sure, you dont leave any empty newline in the Procfile
     * Create a new heroku app
     * Click on the resources in the heroku and add heroku postgres database for the project
     * Heroku postgres will create the database_url in the config vars, just copy that and 
       paste in the env.py file of your project in the github.
     * If you are using the cloudinary for your project then you will have to copy
       the cloudinary_url and paste in the env.py file same like database_url.
     * In the config vars, you have to create the Port: 8000 and secret key for your project
       and also copy and paste that secret key in env.py file of your project
     * After all this done, click on the deploy tab and connect your repository you want to 
       deploy with the heroku and click on the deploy branch
     * Your project has been deployed now and you can see your project
       clicking on the open app button.
